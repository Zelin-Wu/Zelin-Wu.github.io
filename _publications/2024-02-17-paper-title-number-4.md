excerpt: 'This paper presents a novel framework based on the evolutionary neural network to solve the generalized Black-Scholes equation arising in the financial market efficiently
and accurately. We first employ the evolutionary neural network to parameterize the PDE involved in option pricing into ODE. Thus we may use a standard ODE solver to solve the ODE problem. The framework is flexible and can handle various boundary conditions and
terminal conditions, allowing customization based on specific market requirements and scenarios. Moreover, our method
offers a reliable and deterministic solution methodology for the pricing framework, as it does not rely on stochastic training. This deterministic nature enhances the reliability and stability of our approach, making it well-suited for real-world applications in option pricing and financial markets. The experiments on multiple settings are carried out to illustrate the applicability and accuracy of the proposed framework.'
