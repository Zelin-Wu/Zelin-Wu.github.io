Hi, there! Welcome to my homepage!

My name is **Zelin Wu**, I am an incoming graduate student at the [University of Bonn](https://www.uni-bonn.de/en) studying [Mathematics](https://www.mathematics.uni-bonn.de/studium/en/study-programs/master-program-mathematics). Before that, I graduated with **Magna Cum Laude** from the [Southern University of Science and Technology(SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/) in Shenzhen, China, and obtained my **Bachelor of Science** degree in 07.2024.

It paces a winding journey towards Mathematics

Looking back, I am thankful for the seemingly risky decisions I made in choosing **SUSTech** instead of the **Top 5** universities in China, even though I had this opportunity with my above-the-threshold College Entrance Examination score.
This newly emerging university offers the flexibility to explore new things rather than prefixing a major at enrollment like most universities in China.

The story went as follows:

[Computer Science](https://cse.sustech.edu.cn/en/) \\(\Longrightarrow\\) [Data Science](https://stat-ds.sustech.edu.cn/?lang=en-us) \\(\Longrightarrow\\) [Mathematics](https://math.sustech.edu.cn/?lang=en)

The detailed story can be found in this blog. (Not available yet)
