## How the story begins
In the fall of 2023, I, along with my peers, took a renowned course [EECS 182/282A](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Courses/CS282A/) at the University of California, Berkeley. This advanced course, accessible to both graduate and undergraduate students, delves deep into the intricacies of deep learning, even touching upon research papers published as recently as two months prior.


Despite earning full credit and achieving an extraordinary score of 107 out of 100 with bonuses and finally getting a recommendation letter, I noticed that some of my classmates grappled with the course material. To address this, we engaged in post-class discussions and sought out valuable online resources. Among these was a series by [StatQuest with Josh Starmer](https://statquest.org), which simplifies complex models in an incredibly approachable manner.

Recognizing a gap in accessible educational content on the Chinese Internet, we reached out to the creator of StatQuest and secured authorization to open an account and translate his videos into Chinese. This initiative aimed to bridge the knowledge divide and make these resources available to a broader audience on the Bilibili platform. 

## Achievements

Our efforts have not gone unnoticed. To date, we have subtitled and translated over 30 videos, amassing a following of more than 38,000 enthusiasts with nearly 500k view counts. The account and details may be found [here](https://space.bilibili.com/3546620985608836?spm_id_from=333.337.0.0).

Witnessing our work's positive impact on Chinese learners is incredibly rewarding and serves as a testament to our commitment to education and community.
