collection: publications
permalink: /publication/Evolutionary-Neural-Networks-for-Option-Pricing
excerpt: 'This paper proposed a novel approach called Evolutionary Neural Network to solve option pricing problems. Evolutionary Neural Network has time-variable parameters, transforming the time-dependent PDEs into ODEs and then applying a standard ODE solver to solve it. This framework is flexible with boundary conditions and can scale up to higher dimensions, allowing pricing customized options.'
