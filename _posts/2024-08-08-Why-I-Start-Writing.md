We live within the scenes we create, not the memories we leave behind. Yet, some memories are worth documenting, for they become part of the scene when we look back once again. <!--more-->

To be honest, it is not a proper question. I've been writing for a long time, but most of my work is handwritten and primarily in Chinese. There are two main reasons why I started writing English blogs on my personal website:

**Convenience**: As I began to pursue education across the world, I quickly realized that carrying a large diary book with me might not be the best idea. I attended high school outside my home county, earned my bachelor's degree out of my home province, spent a semester abroad in the United States, and now I'm on a journey to pursue a master's degree in Germany. Throughout these experiences, the need to digitize my handwritten notes became increasingly urgent. Otherwise, they would take up valuable space in my luggage when boarding a plane and could even lead to extra inspections at immigration or customs.


**Consolidation**: I often write content on social media and blog platforms like Zhihu, Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book), CSDN, and even on my WeChat official account. However, these writings are so dispersed that I sometimes struggle to locate them. Creating this personal website offers a perfect opportunity to aggregate all my content in one place.

**What will the content include?**
* Replications of blogs from other platforms
* Technical instructions that might be helpful
* Notes on papers I plan to read in the future
* Self-learning notes
* Lecture notes
